                Dear Diary,
                </P>    
                <p> Oh man, where do I begin. Well for starters, I'm barely alive! Yea, would you bellieve me if I told you, that a mae boy, nay, a BABY defied my powers and now I'm the one dying!? But, I'm trying to stay positive-met a friend today. His name is Phlem. He is just so happy about everything. I'm trying to be more like him. Well have to get going our wagon leaves tomorrow for Oregon! Can't wait!!!

                    I saw a rattle snake today, I thought it was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. I adopted it, now I have a huge snake!

                Good Morrow Dear Friend,
                </p>
                <p>
                I am a little down today. I feel my evil slipping away when I spend more and more time with Phlem. Maybe I should have my snake bit him. Venom always works!>

                Morning Diary!

                <p>
                Can I vent to you for a second? It's Phelm...ugh...I know he was super happy and I liked that, but now it's getting to be way too much. He asked me to see my snake-yea! I'm seriously rethinking asking him to journey with me to the Chamber of Secrets.
