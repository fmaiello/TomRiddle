But, I'm trying to stay positive-met a friend today. His name is Phlem. He is just so happy about everything. I'm trying to be more like him. Well have to get going our wagon leaves tomorrow for Oregon! Can't wait!!!\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                Xoxo Voldy\r\n                </p>\r\n            <h2> Second Post (dated May 1757)</h2>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Yo diars,\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    I saw a rattle snake today, I thought it was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
